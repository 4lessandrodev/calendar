# Configurable Calendar Lib

[Portuguese Version](./LEIAME.md)

The **Configurable Calendar Lib** is a library developed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of personalized calendars. With a well-defined tree structure, it allows for intuitive and flexible navigation from the year level down to the time slots.

## Tree Structure

The library operates on a hierarchical tree structure as follows:

- **Year**: Each year can be configured and will point to months.
- **Month**: Within a year, each month contains weeks.
- **Week**: Each week has days.
- **Day**: Each day is subdivided into hours.
- **Hour**: Within a day, each hour contains time slots.

This tree structure enables clear and efficient organization of events and information over time.

## Key Features

3. **At Specific Intervals**: Configure the calendar for specific days (e.g., every 15 days, 30 days) from an initial date, defining the start time, end time, and slot duration.
